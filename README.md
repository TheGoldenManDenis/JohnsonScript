# JohnsonScript
Simple language with graphics features implemented via Xlib, with an interpreter written in C, and a trans-compiler that generates C code.

To build/compile, you need to be sure the package 'libxext-dev' is installed. 
Make "compile.sh" executable and run it. You must first cd to the johnsonscript source directory otherwise it won't work.
